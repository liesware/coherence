- - - - - --------[ 2.- WikiLeaks and Julian Assange in great danger


At the time of writing this (June 15, 2010), WikiLeaks Founder Julian
Assange is being hunted by Pentagon over a possibly massive 260.000
diplomatic cables leak, after ex-'hacker' Adrian Lamo turned the
supposed whistleblower to the FBI and ex-'hacker' Kevin Poulsen broke the
very 1st rule of journalism on Wired by revealing his name.

Daniel Ellsberg, who gained fame when he leaked the Pentagon Papers in 1971
in hopes of ending the Vietnam War, told MSNBC's Dylan Ratigan that he not
only sees a parallel between himself and the person who recently leaked a
video of an assault by US forces on Iraqi civilians but also fears for the
safety of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who published the video.

“What if WikiLeaks was a sort of Wiki-BitTorrent, served by thousands of
people around the world running a background process on their computers,”
mused  Edward Benson, a Ph.D. student at the MIT Computer Science and
Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.

“No fundraising needed here, it’s all P2P. And if the Wiki is maintained
Wikipedia style, then we no longer need to pay for a centralized staff to
curate it. Plus, there’s no centralized staff to kill or jail. It can be a
decentralized, collaborative process.”

WikiLeaks has started to serve Magnet links, yet the role of the Editor
(Julian) is maintained in order to supervise and to assign priorities
to what is leaked and what is not.

Unfortunately, this puts the role of the Editor in great personal danger
and in risk of being 'totally incapacitated' —CIA's term to refer to Daniel
Ellsberg— by potential enemies while it dramatically slows down the
release process.

By its own nature, WikiLeaks mirror servers are limited in numbers, and
very much resource-hungry during media peaks. 

Being limited in numbers means that they are prone to attack, DDoS, 
international IP bans, governmental inclusion in blacklists... etc. etc.
These are single point of failure that threaten the infrastructure of the
whole system.


Project Mayhem 2012 aims to circumvent these issues.

Project Mayhem 2012 turns into a real uncensorable Superorganism that
predates the net: 

an uncensorable civil cipherspace ontop the cyberspace.

In other words, we would like to help Mr. Obama to fulfill his promises
and to make them extensible to the whole of society. World. Wide.

____________________________________________________________________

Protect Whistleblowers:

"Often the best source of information about waste, fraud, and abuse in 
government is an existing government employee committed to public 
integrity and willing to speak out. Such acts of courage and patriotism, 
which can sometimes save lives and often save taxpayer dollars, should 
be encouraged rather than stifled. We need to empower federal employees 
as watchdogs of wrongdoing and partners in performance. Barack Obama 
will strengthen whistleblower laws to protect federal workers who expose 
waste, fraud, and abuse of authority in government. Obama will ensure 
that federal agencies expedite the process for reviewing whistleblower 
claims and whistleblowers have full access to courts and due process."

>:PROJECT MAYHEM 2012


Time has come to encourage COURAGE and to issue a CALL TO HACKZION
for PROJECT MAYHEM 2012. 


Project Mayhem 2012 is a Mutant Egregor Reality-Hacking Wargame.

Reality Hacking is any phenomenon which EMERGES from the nonviolent use of
legally ambiguous digital tools in pursuit of politically, socially or
culturally subversive ends.

An Egregor (also "Egregore") is an occult concept representing a
"thoughtform" or "collective group mind", an autonomous psychic entity made
up of, and influencing, the thoughts of a group of people. The symbiotic
relationship between an Egregor and its group has been compared to the more
recent, non-occult concepts of the CORPORATION (AS A LEGAL ENTITY) and the
meme.

No 'perfectly ideal' p2p darknet design is going to be explained here.

Instead, we are going to do something WAY BETTER:

Project Mayhem 2012 is a [Metaheuristically/Hyper-heuristic] self-
actualizing self-repairable IDEAS GENERATOR:

TYLER, its 'problem child', paraphrasing Albert Hoffman.


Project Mayhem 2012 is a passionated Swarm Intelligence Egregor,
iMAGInaCKtive, ants/locusts/bees-colony alike, hard workingly playful,
creative, Groucho Marxist, joy free and quasi-fnord free, fully open to
friends and foes, transparent, independent, non-profit, apolitical but
chaotically fnOrdered while dynamically Sampo-Adhocratic, non-violent
though more than 'strike hard' capable, autonomous, self-sustained and
sharing community to brainstorm ideas and coordinate volunteers everywhere
in the development of TYLER.

Project Mayhem 2012 will be the biggest HACKARTISTIC joint challenge ever
for the very top hacktivists, coders, cryptoanarchists, cypherpunks and
non-violent Civil Rights, Internet Censorship and Freedom of Speech
activists everywhere to collaborate to jointly BRAINSTORM IDEAS and to
develop TYLER.

To avoid stalling, we won't aim at 'perfection': errors happen... 
Everything is OK!

Any big problem is only a META-PROBLEM: a problem about solving problems:
a microcosm SPIRAL that mimics the growth of a Macrocosmic SPIRAL.

'Almost good enough' might be MORE than a 'good enough' mentality.
Less Syntactics, More Semantics.

Nobody knows everything that is known, but all together, we know it ALL.

'Evolutionary Computing', 'Adaptative Thinking', 'Dynamically Adhocratic'
and 'Mutating problem solving' are key elements here.

We don't aim to find the 'best' solution, as there might be infinite ways
to achieve a single goal: we aim to MOVE UPWARDS the spiral.

Or, in Herman Hesse's words:

"We have learned a lot, Siddhartha, there is still much to learn. We are 
not going around in circles, we are moving UP, the circle is a SPIRAL, we 
have already ascended many a level."


Obviously Project Mayhem 2012 will ALWAYS respect the Law:

we don't fight against ANYTHING: we will simply ADAPT around it, 
and then make it CHANGE to fit our Swarm Intelligence NEEDS of Peace,
Justice, Freedom, Beauty and Truth.

Project Mayhem 2012 is a Worldwide GrouchoMarxist Re-Evolution Party
celebration of Freedom.

Party not as in as in ['Black vs. White'/'Red vs. Gold'] but as in
'DOING IT 4 TEH LULZ'.

"There's nothing more dangerous than sometone who wants to make the world a
better place.
If you want to say something and have people listen then you have to wear
a MASK.
If you want to be HONEST then you have to live a LIE.
I like to think I have the guts to stand up anonymously in a western
democracy and call for things no-one else believes in - like Peace and
Justice and Freedom."

Project Mayhem 2012 is a 'poeTic ERRORIST' invisible yet very palpable
anti-anti-non-Corporation-but-MAYBE-Not:

we are all errorisTs
errare humanum est

 1. ERRORISM: Concept and action are based on the idea that "error" is
 reality's principle of order.

 2. ERRORISM is a philosophically erroneous position, a ritual of negation,
 a disorganized organization: failure as perfection, error as appropriate
 move.

 3. The field of action of ERRORISM contains all those practices that aim
 at the LIBERATION of the human being and language.

 4. CONFUSION and SURPRISE, black humour and ABSURDITY are the favorite
 tools of the errorists.

 5. Lapses and failed acts are an ERRORIST delight.

"The poeTic ERRORIST behaves like a confidence-TRICKSTER whose aim is not
money but CHANGE.

The medieval Assassins founded a "State" which consisted of a network of
remote mountain valleys and castles, separated by thousands of miles,
strategically invulnerable to invasion, connected by the information flow
of secret agents, at war with all governments, and devoted only to
KNOWLEDGE.

Where our KNOWLEDGE of BEAUTY harmonizes with the Ludus Naturae,

                       *** SORCERY BEGINS ***

No, not spoon-bending or horoscopy, not the Golden Dawn or make-believe

weak blavatskian crap."

- - - - - --------[ 3.2 - TYLER. 'Ordo ab KOH.' Use soap.


Narrator: What are we doing tonight?
Tyler Durden: Tonight? We make soap. 

— 'Ordo ab KOH.'

The saponification of fats with KOH is used to prepare the corresponding
"potassium SOAPS," which are softer than the more common sodium
hydroxide-derived soaps. Because of their softness and greater solubility,
potassium soaps require less water to liquefy, and can thus contain
MORE CLEANING AGENT than liquefied sodium soaps.


TYLER is a massively distributed and decentralized Wikipedia-style P2P
cipherspace structure impregnable to censorship.

TYLER will avoid single point of failures by implementing a distributed
and crowdsourced karma-based TRUST 'Authority' in order to prioritize leaks
relevance and visibility while minimizing information poisoning.
This solution successfully solves the single point of failure inherent to
the role of an Editor.

TYLER will gather an unprecedented number of the best hackers and coders
ever to develop its structure from scratch, from the lessons learned from
the Freenet, TOR, GNUnet, eMule, BitTorrent, I2P, Tribler and related
projects.

TYLER will end its betatesting phase the 5th of noVember, 2012.
TYLER will go wild on the net on 12-12-2012, massively flashmob style.

Machines are usually hacked via 'interlink bugs'.
Humans are usually hacked via 'limbic system bugs'.
This date has been purposely chosen to PLAY with the 2012 meme.
As everybody knows, it's OBVIOUS that prophecies & MagicK do **NOT** exist:
 
The best way to predict the future is to CREATE IT.

unprecedented amount of Corporate, Financial, Military and State leaks that
will have been secretly gathered by millions of CONSCIENTIOUS citizens, vigilants, 
whistleblowers and insiders worldwide, dormant cells of a global
'Fight Club' from all countries, patiently waiting for the time to SWARM 
the Egregor's Consciousness in perfect synchrony.

Once TYLER be on the wild and Truths be revealed:

"We have to create culture, don't watch TV, don't read magazines, don't 
even listen to NPR. Create your own roadshow. The nexus of space and 
time where you are now is the most immediate sector of your universe, 
and if you're worrying about Michael Jackson or Bill Clinton or somebody 
else, then you are disempowered, you're giving it all away to icons, 
icons which are maintained by an electronic media so that you want to 
dress like X or have lips like Y. This is shit-brained, this kind of 
thinking. That is all cultural diversion, and what is real is you and 
your friends and your associations, your highs, your orgasms, your 
hopes, your plans, your fears. And we are told 'no', we're unimportant, 
we're peripheral. 'Get a degree, get a job, get a this, get a that.' And 
then you're a player, you don't want to even play in that game. You want 
to reclaim your mind and get it out of the hands of the cultural 
engineers who want to turn you into a half-baked moron consuming all 
this trash that's being manufactured out of the bones of a dying world." 

— Terence McKenna

"The syntactical nature of reality, the real secret of magic, is that 
the world is made of words. And if you know the words that the world is 
made of, you can make of it whatever you wish." 

— Terence McKenna

"The creative act is a letting down of the net of human imagination into 
the ocean of chaos on which we are suspended, and the attempt to bring 
out of it ideas. 

It is the night sea journey, the lone fisherman on a tropical sea with 
his nets, and you let these nets down - sometimes, something tears 
through them that leaves them in shreds and you just row for shore, and 
put your head under your bed and pray. 

At other times what slips through are the minutiae, the minnows of this 
ichthyological metaphor of idea chasing. But, sometimes, you can 
actually bring home something that is food, food for the human community 
that we can sustain ourselves on and go forward." 

— Terence McKenna

"You are an explorer, and you represent our species, AND THE GREATEST 
GOOD YOU CAN DO IS TO BRING BACK A NEW IDEA, because our world is 
endangered by the absence of good ideas. Our world is in crisis because 
of the absence of consciousness." 

— Terence McKenna

"Western civilization is a loaded gun pointed at the head of this planet." 

— Terence McKenna

"The imagination is the goal of history. I see culture as an effort to 
literally realize our collective dreams." 

— Terence McKenna

"Chaos is what we've lost touch with. This is why it is given a bad 
name. It is feared by the dominant archetype of our world, which is Ego, 
which clenches because its existance is defined in terms of control." 

— Terence McKenna

"If the words 'life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness' don't 
include the right to experiment with your own consciousness, then the 
Declaration of Independence isn't worth the hemp it was written on." 

— Terence McKenn

"How much can you know thyself, you've never been in a fight?
I don't wanna die without any scars.
So come on: hit me before I lose my nerve!"
— Tyler Durden.



"I believe in the right of the people to rule. I believe the majority of the
plain people of the United States will, day in and day out, make fewer
mistakes in governing themselves than any smaller class or body of men, no
matter what their training, will make in trying to govern them.

Friends, our task as Americans is to strive for social and industrial
justice, achieved through the genuine rule of the people. This is our end,
our purpose. The methods for achieving the end are merely expedients, to be
finally accepted or rejected according as actual experience shows that they
work well or ill. But in our hearts we must have this lofty purpose, and we
must strive for it in all earnestness and sincerity, or our work will come
to nothing.

In order to succeed we need leaders of inspired idealism, leaders to whom
are granted great visions, who dream greatly and strive to make their
dreams come true; who can kindle the people with the fire from their own 
burning souls. The leader for the time being, whoever he may be, is but an
instrument, to be used until broken and then to be cast aside; and if he is
worth his salt he will care no more when he is broken than a soldier cares
when he is sent where his life is forfeit in order that the victory may be
won. In the long fight for righteousness the watchword for all of us is
spend and be spent. It is of little matter whether any one man fails or
succeeds; but the cause shall not fail, for it is the cause of mankind."

— 'The Right of the People to Rule' by Theodore Roosevelt. March 20, 1912.


"Don't give yourselves to these unnatural men, machine men, with machine
minds and machine hearts.
You are not machines! You are not cattle! You are men!
You have the love of humanity in your hearts!
You don't hate - only the unloved hate. Only the unloved and the unnatural.

Soldiers! - don't fight for slavery, fight for liberty!


YOU THE PEOPLE HAVE THE POWER, the power to CREATE MACHINES, the power to
create happiness!


SOLDIERS! in the name of democracy, LET US ALL UNITE!"

— Final Speech of "The Great Dictator".
  Charlie Chaplin, 1940.

“When the power of Love overcomes the love of Power,
the world will know Peace."
— Jimi Hendrix


"Goodbye," he said.
"Goodbye," said the fox. "And now here is my secret, a very simple secret:

It is only with the heart that one can see rightly.
What is essential is invisible to the eye."

"What is essential is invisible to the eye," the Little Prince repeated,
so that he would be sure to remember.

"It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so
important."

"It is the time I have wasted for my rose--" said the Little Prince, so
that he would be sure to remember.

"Men have forgotten this truth," said the fox.
"But you must not forget it.
You become responsible, forever, for what you have tamed.
You are responsible for your rose..."

"I am responsible for my rose," the Little Prince repeated, so that he
would be sure to remember.

— Antoine de Saint-Exupery. 'The Little Prince', 1943.

"Don't call my name, don't call my name, Alejandro."
— Lady Gaga. Alejandro, 2010.

"This is XP--ESPAA-RTA!!!"


"...e IO etterno duro."
— The Divine Comedy. Inferno. Canto III: The Gate of Hell.
  Dante Alighieri, 1317.

 
Trinity: Neo... nobody has ever done this before.
Neo: That's why it's going to work.

Earth, so mighty an Earthquake and so Great."

"And the LOCUSTS had a King over them, which is the Angel of the Bottomless
Pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in the Greek tongue
hath his name Apollyon."
